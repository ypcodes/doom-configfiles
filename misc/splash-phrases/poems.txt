To be, or not to be: that is the question.
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever.
'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all.
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” / I took the one less traveled by.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
